## App Description

This app is a simple and unique take on a tasklist app. Use TaskMaster - Daily Habit Builder as a tool that reminds you of simple tasks to do. Ever wanted to learn how to knit? Create a tasklist based on knitting and add tasks such as "Design knitted blanket" and "Start knitting!" to be reminded of these tasks each day. Need to remind yourself to take out the garbage, create a tasklist for general around the house things and add it! You can customize the tasklists and tasks to your needs!
